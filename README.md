"Survival turnover analysis" 
In this analysis we are going to analyze the employee's turnover.The analysis is structured in 3 main parts:
First,using survival analysis methods ,we are going to analyse the survival function and the OR of the differents features(KM function and cox model).

Second,  we will go trough a classification report to classificate that employee in base of the event "leaving the company" and at the end, we will extimate a logit model to predict the probability to "leave" the job to have this information in term of probability.

Last step,to reassume in simple way, we will deploy a simple streamlit app to predict,for differen time,the probability to leave the company.

be awere that to avoid possibles etic-related issue,we are going to select only fews of the features...
